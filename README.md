Salesforce CRM for small business owner

Why this app?

This web app is to help small business owner keep track of their customer information and to help organize important information such as 
-appointment making
-notes
Most importantly, this is to help personalize small business owners. Every busienss has different needs in a CRM and the existing CRM out there doesnt always meet their demands and business model


Steps to get new customer to business
FB Ad -> Lead Generations -> Custom CRM Web App (to collect all user information)



I decdied to create this application because i worked for a start up that help small business grow and one thing that was critical for all business to get more customer is to be able to communicate to our customer effectively. Because we didnt have enough team memebrs to support, and on a budget, we had to communicate with clients customer manually and no CRm out there could use text messeging, email, and fb messenging in one app. There had to be multiple tabs open and that it very unorganize. We seen small salon open multiple tabs on their computer like excel, crm, facebook, instagram, google voice, email, etc. Basically whoever is in the front desk is multitasking like crazy.  Ive tested so many crm out there and no crm has been user friendly except for zoho. Zoho is probably the most modular CRM out there, but it can be improved.
